To explain things first, TESA means Tools for Easy Survey Applications. The idea is that it would improve the job of Reseachers by doing some of the tasks that are necessary to make articles, as for example, get maps to spatial analysis or build forms for collect the data.

In this repository the objetive is build some of the features needed for spatial research, for that, is needed to think about locate some point with latitude and longitude in some map, getting the border of counties, states or countries, identify the actual position of the researcher and so on.
